## Course Overview (View Projects Here: [here](https://ngallego.cs3680.com/))

**CMPS 3680 Server-Side Web** is a junior-level course focusing on current trends in server-side web development, covering topics such as web servers, internet protocols, data interchange formats, information storage and retrieval, and security. The course combines both theoretical concepts and hands-on labs, with students developing fully functional web applications throughout the semester.

### Key Topics Covered:
- HTML, JavaScript, and CSS review
- Introduction to PHP and server-side development
- Data storage using SQL and NoSQL databases
- Client/server communication and validation
- Web security risks and mitigation
- APIs and data interchange formats like JSON and XML
- Object-Oriented Programming in PHP

## My Role as a Teaching Assistant

As a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** for this course, I assisted with the following:

- **Lab Sessions**: Facilitated 150-minute weekly lab sessions where students worked on server-side web development tasks. I provided guidance on assignments, helped troubleshoot issues, and ensured students understood the material.
  
- **Code Reviews**: Performed code reviews for student projects and labs, providing feedback on coding practices, optimization, and debugging.

- **Lectures**: Supported the instructor during lectures by assisting with demonstrations, answering student questions, and clarifying key concepts related to PHP, web servers, and APIs.

- **Grading**: Assisted in grading lab assignments, projects, and final presentations, ensuring fair and consistent assessment based on the course rubrics.

### Major Responsibilities

- **Project Guidance**: Helped students during midterm and final projects, which involved building fully functional web applications, covering topics like form processing, database interaction, and user authentication.
  
- **Mentorship**: Provided one-on-one support during office hours, helping students overcome challenges in learning advanced web development techniques.
  
- **Lab Assignment Support**: Assisted with weekly labs on topics such as:
  - Processing form data in PHP
  - Interfacing with databases using SQL and NoSQL
  - Implementing API endpoints and consuming external APIs
  - Understanding and mitigating security risks in web applications

### Technologies and Tools

- **Languages**: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Custom-built server-side frameworks using PHP
- **Databases**: MySQL, NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **Tools**: Linux server administration, web server configuration (Apache), and Git for version control

## Projects and Labs

- **Midterm Projects**: Guided students through the creation of web applications that integrated various server-side techniques, including data validation, form processing, and database interaction.
  
- **Final Project**: Helped students develop, propose, and present fully functional web applications based on real-world scenarios. The projects involved server-side scripting, secure data storage, and API usage.

## Impact as a TA

- **Leadership Experience**: As a **first-year freshman**, I was one of the youngest students to serve as a TA for a junior-level course, where I developed my leadership and mentorship skills.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Gained deeper expertise in server-side development and security, while also improving my communication skills by explaining complex topics to students.
